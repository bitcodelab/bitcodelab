Hello and welcome,

I use this account to hold my personal repositories. These are projects I develop in my free time, from ideas that pop up every once in a while. My dream is that someday there will be intelligent machines. In the meanwhile, I focus on developing clean, well documented, easy to mantain and efficient to run computer code.

The languages I feel more passionate about, and have a higher degree of expertise, are:

Java<br>

Javascript<br>

I also have programmed in the following languages before.
